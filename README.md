# Generative AI Project

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook `gen_ai_1.ipynb`, which demonstrates various techniques and models used in generative AI.

## Overview

The notebook covers the following topics:

- **Basic Implementation of FLAN-T% LLM Model**: Initial implementation and conversation summaries without any prompt engineering.
- **Colab Integration**: Created and integrated using Google Colab for ease of use and collaboration.

## Installation

To run the notebook, ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed. You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install jupyter
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harsh-Mathur-1503/genrative_ai.git
   cd genrative_ai
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `gen_ai_1.ipynb` and run the cells to execute the code.

## Results

The notebook includes sections that generate and visualize the results of the generative models. These visualizations provide insights into the model's performance and the quality of the generated data.
